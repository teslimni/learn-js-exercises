Thanks so much for the response Josh!

I mostly didn’t want to clutter the WSL focused article details about hardware. :) I got the HP Spectre x360! I got this years’ model, with the 8th generation i7 quad core processor, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and a 2 GB dedicated graphics card. Also, as an added bonus, it’s got a 15 inch 4k touchscreen display that folds all the way around, which is fun!

In terms of processing power, it’s fantastic! Not to mention a lovely premium body, great keyboard, and huge trackpad which I love personally. ;)
